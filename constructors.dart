/*
  Constructor: Whatever code you write in the constructor will first be executed 
  before any code is executed.
    - default constructor (We do not have to explicitly define it because it exists by default).
    - Parametized constructor (have parameters).
    - Named constructor.
    - Constant constructor.
  You can have multiple Named constructors but you cannot have default and parametized constructors at the same time.
